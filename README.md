# My history

## My name is Katlego Johnson, I am 26 years old and I live in Pretoria West.I enjoy reading books and jogging,but only when the weather allows me to.In my youth I struggled with autism
but throughout the years I tught myself to speak nd connect with the people around me in a genuine way.
I started off my professional career as an four years ago with tutor abc where I performedd a full cycle of duties and now I have a wealth of experience conducting research and 
compiling written reports while analysis all the findings myself.
I use to work in marketing because I enjoyed helping brands stand out and increase their sales in order to improve their business.I have to worked closely with my superiors in 
the department to better hone my intersonal skills with people of all walks of life.
I was ecstatic to hear that I would have an oppotunity to study in the ever growing field of data science,I will admit that I have limited data science experience but I feel that
I am well versed in probelm solving skills and I have backround in the field of cybersecurity which I hope will one day result in me being apart of your dynamic team.
I never thought of writing an autobiography before.It is a task I associate with celebrities and old people at the end of their lives, but I now realise we all do it as a backround activity.
I may not be publishing my story I am writing them in my minds never the less.Every day I find myself weaving a story about who I am,where I am going and why things happened the way they did. 
And most of us are very harsh narrators of our life stories  .I am learning to tell very different and far kinder stories about myself in my head.I am confident I will be a valuable asset to the Umuzi team .
